OPTICS Algorithm
================

OPTICS, or 'Ordering Points To Identify Clustering Structure', is a
density based clustering algorithm that I use for segmentation of 
LiDAR points.

I'm currently working on a cluster visualizer, and also a recursive
implementation of the algorithm. You can find my current base-level
OPTICS code on `my github page.`_
