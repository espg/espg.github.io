I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Colorado School of Mines, with
`Matthew Siegfried <https://www.mines.edu/glaciology/people/siegfried/>`__. I
completed my doctoral degree in 2019 under my advisor `Waleed Abdalati
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waleed_Abdalati>`__, at the University of
Colorado, Boulder, where I still hold a research appointment at the
`Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)
<http://cires.colorado.edu>`__.  My research focuses on understanding the
dynamic changes in the polar regions, particularly changes that are happening
on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. In addition to `polar field work
<http://ciresblogs.colorado.edu/firncover/>`__, I use both remote sensing and
machine learning to better characterize crevasses throughout the ice sheets.

My resume is here: :download:`pdf <./grigsby_resume_2019.pdf>`.
