I'm currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Colorado, Boulder,
where I work as a research assistant at the `Cooperative Institute for
Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) <http://cires.colorado.edu>`__ for
my advisor `Waleed Abdalati <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waleed_Abdalati>`__.
My research focuses on understanding the dynamic changes in the polar
regions, particularly changes that are happening on the Greenland and
Antarctic ice sheets. In addition to `polar field work
<http://ciresblogs.colorado.edu/firncover/>`__, I use both remote sensing
and machine learning to better characterize crevasses throughout the ice
sheets. The name **rugous** refers to *"having a rough, ridged,
or wrinkled surface"*, which reminds me of how crevasses fields look when
you fly over them.

My CV is here: :download:`pdf <./Curriculum_Vitae_Grigsby_2_pages__may_2016.pdf>`.
