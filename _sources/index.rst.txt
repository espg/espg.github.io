Currently taking a sabbatical to travel, train, and reflect on my next career steps.
   
It's been 12 years since I took any sort of extended break. In 2007 I took
about a year and a half break from my undergraduate studies to figure out
what I wanted to do with my education-- it was incredibly helpful, and when
I returned to school in 2009 I was a *far* better student. I finished my
bachelors in the summer of 2011 (checking off a freshman writing course I
needed to graduate), and then went to grad school that same fall. I did a
three year Master's at UCSB under Dr. Dar Roberts, working on research thru
the summers as you do in graduate school, and then immediately started
working for my PhD Advisor `Dr. Waleed Abdalati
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waleed_Abdalati>`__, at CU in the summer of
2014 even as continued to draw a 25% appointment to close up projects back
at UCSB. I defended in 2019, and then had two and half weeks before I
started working as a postdoctoral fellow at the Colorado School of Mines,
with `Matthew Siegfried
<https://www.mines.edu/glaciology/people/siegfried/>`__. I secured a
position as an Assistant Scientist for the ICESat-2 Project Science office
at NASA Goddard (Section 615)-- a fantastic opportunity that took me from
Boulder, CO to Washington, DC... with the 2021 three day Martin Luther King
weekend being the only time that separated my employment at Mines from the
start of my time at NASA. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)
recruited me while I was at NASA, offering a position as Research &
Development Scientist. I actually initially declined, but NGA made a revised
offer that would have me skip a full GS equivalent grade within the Federal
Government, and I was curious to see what that world looked like behind the
curtain.  Since I loved my project at NASA, I elected to keep working on it
as long as possible, and took two days off (a weekend) in November of 2021
between ending my role as a NASA contractor and starting as a civil servant
within the Intelligence Community. 
   
I learned quite a lot at NGA from 2021 to 2023. I ran a program, made policy,
and started initiatives within the agency that continue to this day. But
ultimately, I decided that I wanted to aim my career in a different
direction. The Intelligence Community has incredible resources, but it's
also a place that can be a bit sticky and hard to transition out of once you
arrive-- there are restrictions on publishing (prepublication review, which
makes it difficult to collaborate), on engaging with policy (the Hatch Act),
and even what work and projects you can put on a resume. I wasn't sure what
I wanted to do when I took my sabbatical from college in 2007, but I knew
very well what I wanted to do when I returned in 2009... clearly enough that
I followed that path for over decade with excitement and passion. So in
January of 2023, I decided to take a risk and do the same thing again-- take
some intentional time off to make a new plan for the next decade or two.

I still hold a research affiliation (although not a paid appointment) at the
`Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)
<https://cires.colorado.edu>`__, but my research focus is shifting. For the
last decade, I worked on understanding the dynamic changes in the polar
regions, particularly changes that are happening on the Greenland and Antarctic
ice sheets. Most of that work used remote sensing and machine learning to
better characterize crevasses throughout the ice sheets, with some occasional
`polar field work <https://ciresblogs.colorado.edu/firncover/>`__. Currently,
I'm taking a harder look at Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence more
broadly. It's a fast moving field, but I think I can make a real impact given
my science background, which is just broad enough to make me look at things
slightly differently than the deluge of ML and AI engineers.
