<h2>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before I was a scientist, I worked for UnixOps supporting research computing–
mainly building software. The fact that the University of Colorado, Boulder
campus needed almost a dozen system admins to build and rebuild software tells
you something about how much of a hassle it is; builds are often cryptic,
requirements conflict, and things constantly break between versions.</p>
<p>I’ve used various package managers over the years– homebrew when I had a mac,
pip and conda for python, and various linux platform specific managers like
pacman and apt-get. None of them have been particularly great; homebrew tends
to be a mess and is specific to only OS X. Conda and pip work ok, but they only
manage python packages, and reasonably complex software always includes
non-python dependencies… linear algebra routines for numerics written in
fortran or C, hdf5 libraries, and projection libraries like GDAL come to mind
most quickly. Things have actually gotten worse in the last couple years with
machine learning; builds now expect CUDA, and some frameworks are working on
multi-gpu instances. Getting software up and running is a hassle, to say
nothing of trying to have a colleague replicate your setup when you share code.</p>

<h2>Nix<a class="headerlink" href="#nix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For about the past two years I’ve been using nix to create reproducible,
portable builds. It is by no means perfect– but it is better than anything
else that I’ve tried <em>by far</em>. The major highlights:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Builds don’t break. They may take sometime to figure out, but once they
work, they keep working.</p></li>
<li><p>Builds are portable. If it builds on my linux tablet, it will build on my
HPC cluster. I can email a colleague a human readable text file, and they
can replicate by working environment using a single command from the
command line.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s reasonably cross platform. Linux builds work perfectly between
distros. MacOS tends to be compatible for most things…but some of their
display stuff is strange enough that tweaks are occasionally needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Declarations are functional. I specify what I want, not how to do it. Nix
files are short, and tend to be understandable.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple builds are both possible, and encouraged. You can maintain
libraries built with different options for different projects, even when
those libraries conflict. Need hdf4 for a project, but don’t want to break
hdf5? No problem, the dependency tree for each install has it’s own
namespace.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the above advantages, I maintain a love/hate relationship with nix.
Nix is best described as a language, and the documentation is very much geared
toward getting you to learn the language, instead of helping you to solve
common tasks. Because the real world is messy (new versions that have bugs,
old versions that don’t, or vice versa), getting certain things to work can be
hacky, and unintuitive.</p>

<h2>A Reproducible CUDA &amp; GPU environment<a class="headerlink" href="#a-reproducible-cuda-gpu-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Recently, some of my work has been running Gaussian Process models for
stochastic simulation, specifically on flight lines that have acquired lidar
data over the Antarctic… which is to say that we have a lot of data, and run
time for numeric Monte Carlo simulation is non-trivial. Gaussian Processes has
two steps: fitting a model, and running the stochastic simulation. Both take
about the same amount of runtime. Running prun in ipython shows that the vast
majority of the runtime is dominated by just three function calls: cholesky,
cho_solve, and multivariate_normal. <a class="reference external" href="https://cupy.chainer.org">CuPy</a> does a
great job at handling cholesky– and in fact, multivariate_normal can be
rewritten to use cholesky, which is exactly what I’ve done in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/3018">this PR</a>. However, the last function,
cho_solve is a hassle.</p>
<p>When I was working for the <a class="reference external" href="http://istc-bigdata.org">Intel Big Data ISTC</a>
back in 2013 and 2014, one of the projects that they funded was scalapack,
headed up by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dongarra">Jack Dongarra</a>,
and he expanded (or rather, branched) that project to a new linear algebra
system called magma. <a class="reference external" href="https://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/">Magma</a> is a set of
solvers for heterogeneous compute environments, and will used both CPUs and
GPUs, in some cases utilizing multiple GPUs. Ideally, a large matrix starts in
system memory, and magma sends pieces of the problem to GPUs, so that solvers
are using a hybrid approach.</p>
<p>My normal approach to computing with nix is to define a default.nix script in
the working directory for my project, and then create the build environment
using the nix-shell command within the directory; assuming nix is installed
and in your path, it will check for default.nix and execute the build for you,
setting all library and executable paths for you, along with whatever
environmental variables that you need. Here’s what my default.nix files looks
like to build magma (the long literal at the end breaks syntax highlighting):</p>

<p>Ok, so what’s going on here? If you’ve ever used nix-shell or nix in general,
you’re probably used to the first line of default.nix looking something like
this <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">&lt;nixpkgs&gt;</span> <span class="pre">{};</span></code>, which is fine…but less portable. Nix
packages are pinned to a channel, which updates every 6 months, but this isn’t
automatic. If you email someone a nix script with <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">&lt;nixpkgs&gt;</span>
<span class="pre">{};</span></code>, you have no idea what their nix-channel is set to; are they on stable,
unstable, or 18.03? Nix derivations that work for you once, will always work
in the future– assuming that you execute them against the same channel. If
you use a different channel, they might not build because of changes in the
underlying channel, or they might have different behavior. Case in point: the
above code builds great for nix-channel 19.03, but doesn’t build using Intel’s
math kernel library (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_Kernel_Library">MKL</a>) on channel 19.09 as a
backend for the cpu portion of magma. Why? Who knows, maybe there’s something I
could change in default.nix or magma.nix that would make it use MKL…but I can
guarantee that whoever executes the above version will get my same build, so I
can sidestep the question of if it will build with MKL in the future because
I’m being explicit to use an older version. The first couple lines download a
tar archive of what nix-channel looked like for the 2019 March branch, unpacks
it, and uses those package definitions, regardless of what channel whoever
receives it is on. The other branch ‘current’ isn’t actually needed, but is
included to illustrate that you can mix and match packages between branches–
if GDAL has a feature in 19.09 that you need (or a bug in 19.03 that you want
to avoid), you can build everything using 19.03, and then specify per package
when you want to use a newer or older branch. As an explicit example, if you
wanted a different build of hdf5, all you would do is change line 27
(emphasized) from <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hdf5</span></code> to <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">current.hdf5</span></code> ; python packages are
nested one layer of abstraction in, so to change gdal, you’d probably move it
out of the python package section to buildInputs and specify
<code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">current.python36Packages.gdal</span></code>.</p>
<p>Moving on, <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">stable;</span></code> sets the default to use stable instead of
current. Grammar for nix expects most statements to terminate with a
semicolon, although this isn’t the case for individual list items which are
white space delimited per item. The block</p>

<p>This file is actually nearly identical to this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/61347">merged PR</a>, but is slightly modified to
build a dynamic library, and also to show how to build things outside of the
nixpkgs tree–a useful skill to have when writing your own package derivations
from scratch, or when modifying things to your liking. More specifically, you
can’t modify anything in the nixpkgs tree that is built when you setup nix; any
changes have to specified outside of the tree, either in the default.nix file,
or in a local file that it calls. The magma.nix file differs from the github
version in that it builds a dynamic library instead of a static one, and tells
magma to use MKL instead of libatlas or openblas. Using MKL could actually be
specified from the default.nix file substituting <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(magma.overrides</span> <span class="pre">{</span>
<span class="pre">mklSupport</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">true;})</span></code> in place of <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mag</span></code> on the emphasized line…but we would have to
import the right nixpkgs branch (unstable), and that still wouldn’t build a
shared library. Since the magma build file is being changed anyway, we can just
change line 2 in magma.nix from <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mklSupport</span> <span class="pre">?</span> <span class="pre">false</span></code> to <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mklSupport</span>
<span class="pre">?</span>&#160; <span class="pre">true</span></code> and avoid using the override within default.nix.</p>

<section id="using-the-environment">
<h2>Using the environment<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The point of all this is to make an environment that works for development– the
code that is getting hacked on is changing, and isn’t prepackaged or ready to be
prepackaged. That’s why the default.nix has the python packages pip and wheel,
and why we have this long block that sets environmental variables:</p>
<div class="highlight-nix notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>shellHook = &#39;&#39;
  alias pip=&quot;PIP_PREFIX=&#39;$(pwd)/_build/pip_packages&#39; \pip&quot;
  export PYTHONPATH=&quot;$(pwd)/_build/pip_packages/lib/python3.7/site-packages:\
                     $PYTHONPATH&quot;
  export CUDA_PATH=${pkgs.cudatoolkit}
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&quot;/run/opengl-driver:$CUDA_PATH/lib:\
                          ${pkgs.cudatoolkit.lib}/lib:${mag}/lib&quot;
  export LDFLAGS=&quot;-L/lib -L$/run/opengl-driver&quot;
  export MAGMA=${mag}
  unset SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH&#39;&#39;;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first two lines tell pip where to build packages (in the current directory under
_build), and python where to find them. The next three lines make the CUDA libraries
visible to both pip, and the linker that builds the magma library. The CUDA setup is
actually divided into a hardware driver, and the CUDA library itself; you can have
multiple CUDA libraries, but only one driver. Sadly, the driver is not something that
can be reproducibly built with nix, mainly because whatever system you load onto will
already have a CUDA driver, and there can’t be multiple instances of these since they
interface directly with the hardware. The solution that seems to have the least amount
of overhead is to tell nix to expect the driver in “/run/opengl-driver”, and then to
soft link wherever the system driver is to that directory. You could absolutely tell
nix to build it’s own driver, but this doesn’t work for any multi user systems, so
it’s less portable.</p>
<p>A previous version of this script appended the <strong>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</strong> to the <strong>LDFLAGS</strong>,
but that only works if you have one path in the <strong>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</strong>, since the linker
expects space delimited “-L/$library_path” instead of the normal colon delimited shell
variable. It’s actually extremely annoying that <strong>LDFLAGS</strong> are even needed, since
installers should expect and search the <strong>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</strong>, but for some pip installs,
they don’t pick up nvidia hardware driver. The last entry of <strong>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</strong> makes
sure that when skcuda is run, it loads the magma library.</p>
<p>So what does this all get us? Well, first of all we can clone our branch of CuPy and use
it as a regular import (since the PR hasn’t been merged yet). We can also install an
editable version of sklearn and replace numpy with CuPy. And we can also install
<a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-cuda.readthedocs.io/">skcuda</a> which has bindings for magma. The first
two of those are simple git clone commands followed by pip local installs (sklearn needs
to be told to use the installed numpy instead of building a sandbox version), while
skcuda will pip install fine the normal way (there is no nix package for it, hence why
it is pip installed after the build).</p>
<p>Once the stochastic simulation code is finished, we can roll the git and pip installs into
their own nix file which is imported to default.nix. In the meantime, we can move
the build from our development box to a HPC or cloud service with a minimum of work– just
two files, one nix command, followed by two git pulls and three pip installs to access multi
GPU computing from a jupyter notebook.</p>
